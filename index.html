			<p>This specification defines eBraille, a digital reading format for braille publications.</p>

			<p>eBraille uses an EPUB 3-compatible file set based on the Open Web Platform &#8212; using technologies
				such as XHTML and CSS &#8212; to encode braille in semantically enhanced markup and allow it to adapt to
				the different capabilities of braille reading devices. The file set is designed for both packaged
				distribution to end users and deployment to the web for online and downloadable reading.</p>
		</section>
		<section id="sotd">
			<div data-include="common/status.html" data-include-replace="true"></div>
			<p>The eBraille Working Group is seeking input on all aspects of this document. It is particularly
				interested in implementation experience both creating eBraille publication and creating reading systems
				in which to read them.</p>
		</section>
		<section id="intro">
			<h2>Introduction</h2>

			<section id="overview">
				<h3>Overview</h3>

				<p>Unlike braille formats that focus on interchanging embosser-ready braille, eBraille focuses on
					adapting braille for reading in refreshable braille displays with different line lengths.</p>

				<p>In order to maintain close alignment with mainstream publishing formats, and simplify transcription
					of these works, the eBraille format is built on an EPUB 3-compatible file set &#8212; it
					incorporates XHTML documents, CSS, images, audio, and video. This means that an [=eBraille
					publication=] shares its technology with the web, making it compatible for reading in standard web
					browsers.</p>

				<p>An [=eBraille publication=] differs from reading a typical web site in that the braille is not
					transformed on the fly but comes formatted according to the rules of the regional braille code where
					the publication was produced. Users are not locked into this default display, however. With the
					display flexibility of CSS, and standardized markup practices, they can apply styles for another
					region or even modify the display to their own preferences (e.g., by changing the maximum line
					length).</p>

				<p>eBraille publications are also designed to be flexible for deployment. An eBraille publication can be
					placed on the web, unzipped on a user's local file system, or distributed in EPUB 3-compatible
					packaging. And as web-compatible file sets, they are adaptable to future changes to publishing
					formats.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="relationship-epub3" class="informative">
				<h3>Relationship to EPUB 3</h3>

				<p>The [=eBraille file set=] is designed to be compatible with EPUB 3 [[epub-33]] and adapt to changes
					to that standard. Distribution and consumption on mainstream [=EPUB reading systems=], however, is
					not a primary goal of this format. This specification introduces some additional requirements and
					features beyond those defined in EPUB 3, and it is not expected that mainstream reading systems will
					adapt to these modifications. Consequently, an eBraille publication may not render exactly as
					intended outside of eBraille reading systems.</p>

				<p>The primary difference between the eBraille format and EPUB 3 is [=eBraille publications=] do not
					have to be packaged and distributed in an [=EPUB container=] [[epub-33]] &#8212; they can be
					deployed on the web as an unpackaged set of files. An eBraille publication is packagable in an EPUB
					container when that is the preferred distribution method, but eBraille uses the file extension
						<code>.ebrl</code> not <code>.epub</code>.</p>

				<p>Compatibility with EPUB 3 also means that eBraille relies on the same <a
						data-cite="epub-33#sec-intro-relations">underlying technologies</a> [[epub-33]]. Many of these
					technologies, like [[html]], are referred to as "evergreen" or "living" standards as they are
					updated often and do not have version numbers. Others, like [[svg]], are referred to without a
					specific version number so that the latest recommendation is always the recommended one to use.</p>

				<p>The practical effect of this approach is predominantly beneficial for [=eBraille creators=]. New
					features become available for use as soon as they are standardized; it is not required to wait for a
					new revision of the eBraille standard to allow them. The approach does come with some drawbacks,
					however. eBraille creators also have to keep themselves apprised of changes to the underlying
					technologies, and use their best judgement in some cases as to whether a new feature is supported
					well enough in [=eBraille reading systems=] to begin deploying. In some rare cases, it may also mean
					that content that was previously valid may no longer be, but breaking changes like this usually only
					happen when features are unsupported or are found to have serious security or privacy flaws.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="future-dir" class="informative">
				<h3>Future directions</h3>

				<p>The first version of the eBraille format is focused on creating a reading experience that is
					minimally feature complete for the majority of braille publications. It is not expected that this
					version will handle every unique formatting requirement of every publication type, but future drafts
					and versions of this specification will focus on making the format more feature complete.</p>

				<p>In particular, the working group expects to review the current support decisions for the following
					features:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>scripting &#8212; the use of JavaScript in [=eBraille content documents=] is currently
						prohibited. The working group is seeking further input on the need for dynamic braille before
						allowing scripting as the ability to script documents increases the security and privacy risks
						of the format.</li>
					<li>CSS extensions &#8212; the first version of eBraille uses standard CSS properties to format
						braille content. There may be a need to extend CSS in the future to handle more complex
						formatting cases, which will also require defining reading system implementations.</li>
					<li>embossing &#8212; this version of eBraille is focused on consuming [=eBraille publications=] on
						electronic reading systems, more specifically refreshable braille displays. It is expected that
						a revision is needed to better account for the use case of embossing publications on paper.</li>
				</ul>

						<li>It MUST contain a package document that conforms to <a href="#ebrl-package-doc"></a> and

			<p>If an eBraille publication is packaged for distribution, it MUST adhere to the packaging requirements in

			<p>The rest of this specification covers specific conformance details.</p>
		</section>
		<section id="ebrl-resources">
			<h2>Publication resources</h2>

			<section id="res-intro" class="informative">
				<h3>Introduction</h3>

				<p>An [=eBraille publication=] is typically composed of many resources &#8212; XHTML documents, CSS
					files, tactile graphics, audio, video, etc.</p>

				<p>As an eBraille publication is intended to be easily packaged as a conforming [=EPUB publication=],
					the requirements for publication resources are inherited from EPUB, specifically as defined in <a
						data-cite="epub-33#sec-publication-resources"></a> [[epub-33]].</p>

				<p>This section represents a subsetting of the EPUB requirements, as certain features, such as manifest
					fallbacks, are disallowed in eBraille publications.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="cmt">
				<h3>Core media types</h3>

				<p>To ensure that [=eBraille reading systems=] are capable of rendering the content of [=eBraille
					publications=], only certain widely supported resource types are allowed to be included without
					fallbacks. These are called core media types and are designated by their MIME media type [[rfc2046]]
					(e.g., XHTML documents have the MIME media type <code>application/xhtml+xml</code>).</p>

				<p>Being designated a core media type does not mean that all reading systems are required to support the
					type of resource, however. A reading system without audio capabilities will not be able to render
					audio core media types, for example.</p>

				<p>The list of core media types allowed in eBraille publications is the same as those designated for
					EPUB 3. Some of the key core media types for eBraille include:</p>

				<ul>
					<li><code>application/xhtml+xml</code> &#8212; HTML documents that use the XML syntax [[html]].</li>
					<li><code>text/css</code> &#8212; CSS Style Sheets [[css2]].</li>
					<li><code>image/jpeg</code> &#8212; JPEG Images [[jpeg]]</li>
					<li><code>image/png</code> &#8212; PNG Images [[png]]</li>
					<li><code>image/svg+xml</code> &#8212; SVG images [[svg]]</li>
				</ul>

				<p>The complete list is available in the <a data-cite="epub-33#sec-core-media-types">core media types
						section</a> of [[epub-33]].</p>

				<p>All other media types are considered <a href="foreign-res">foreign resources</a>.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="foreign-res">
				<h3>Foreign resources</h3>

				<p>Foreign resources, unlike <a href="#cmt">core media types</a>, have no guarantee of support in
					reading systems.</p>

				<p>To avoid users not being able to access the content of the [=eBraille publication=], foreign
					resources can only be used if a fallback to a core media type is provided. Fallbacks are provided
					using <a data-cite="epub-33#sec-intrinsic-fallbacks">intrinsic fallback methods</a> [[epub-33]].</p>

				<div class="note">
					<p><a href="#fallbacks">Manifest fallbacks</a> are not supported in eBraille. This means they cannot
						be used to include foreign resources in the <a href="#spine">spine</a> or as a means of
						providing fallbacks for foreign image formats (in the latter case, fallbacks can be provided
						instead using the [[html]] [^img^] and [^picture^] elements' intrinsic fallback
						capabilities).</p>
				</div>

				<p>It is generally best to avoid foreign resources unless absolutely necessary. PDF tactile graphics are
					an example of a foreign resource that may not be avoidable for some [=eBraille creators=], but using
					the [[html]] [^object^] element's intrinsic fallback capabilities can avoid having to duplicate the
					image in a core media type format.</p>

				<aside class="example" title="PDF tactile image with fallback">
					<pre>&lt;object
     data="ebraille/images/clouds.pdf"
     type="application/pdf"
     height="250"
     width="100"
     aria-label="alternative text">
   &lt;p>&lt;!-- description -->&lt;/p>
&lt;/object></pre>
				</aside>
				<aside class="ednote">
					<p>The accessibility of using an <code>object</code> element is still to be determined. Guidance on
						how to embed PDFs may change in a future update.</p>
				</aside>
			</section>

			<section id="fallbacks">
				<h3>Resource fallbacks</h3>

				<p>eBraille does not support the use of <a data-cite="epub-33#sec-manifest-fallbacks">manifest
						fallbacks</a> [[epub-33]].</p>

				<p>The intrinsic fallback methods provided by [[html]] elements are supported.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="res-location">
				<h3>Resource location</h3>

				<p>[=eBraille publications=] do not support [=remote resources=] [[epub-33]]. All publication resources
					MUST be located in or below the [=root directory=], as defined in <a href="#fileset-structure"
					></a>.</p>

				<p>eBraille does not support the <code>file:</code> URL scheme [[rfc8089]] for referencing resources in
					an eBraille publication. Accessing files on the user's local file system presents too great a
					security risk.</p>

				<p>The <code>data:</code> URL scheme MAY be used to embed resources within [=eBraille content
					documents=] per the restrictions outlined in <a data-cite="epub-33#sec-data-urls">Data URLs</a>
					[[epub-33]].</p>
			</section>

			<section id="res-exemptions" class="informative">
				<h3>Exempt resources</h3>

				<p>It is possible to include additional resources in an [=eBraille publication=] that are not part of
					the rendering of the content. EPUB 3 defines resources that are not used in the [=spine=] or
					embedded in [=xhtml content documents=] as exempt from the normal [=core media type resource=]
					restrictions [[epub-33]].</p>

				<p>This means, for example, that [=eBraille creators=] can embed pre-formatted braille in their
					publication in a format such as PDF or BRF. The resource would still be listed in the [=manifest=],
					but it would not be flagged as needing a fallback.</p>

				<p>It would not be possible to link to these resources from the eBraille publication, but the
					publication could note the presence of the resources and include instructions on how to access them
					(e.g., to open the publication with a ZIP tool and navigate to a specific directory).</p>
			</section>

			<section id="res-extensions" class="informative">
				<h3>File extensions</h3>

				<p>Reading systems typically do not rely on file extensions for rendering, so, with a couple of notable
					exceptions for the <a href="#ebrl-package-doc">package document</a> and <a href="#ebrl-nav">primary
						entry page</a>, eBraille does not require specific extensions for the resources in an [=eBraille
					publication=]. The media type declared in the manifest is used as a hint to the nature of each
					resource, but even that declaration is not reliable. Instead, reading systems typically leave
					inspection of resources and their rendering to their underlying browser core.</p>

				<p>The use of standard file extensions for resources should still be considered a best practice,
					however, as it avoids authoring confusion over the nature of resources.</p>

				<p>Some formats have more than one common extension. For example, XHTML documents can use either the
					extension <code>.html</code> or <code>.xhtml</code> and JPEG images can use either <code>.jpg</code>
					or <code>.jpeg</code>. In these cases, either extension is acceptable.</p>

				<div class="note">
					<p>This specification uses the <code>.html</code> extension in examples for [=eBraille content
						documents=] as it is more widely used and recognized than <code>.xhtml</code>, particularly for
						opening the primary entry page.</p>

					<p>The <code>.xhtml</code> extension may be useful if eBraille content documents are opened in a
						browser on a local file system (e.g., for testing), as this triggers some browsers to render the
						content using the correct XML parser. The extension has no effect on documents served over the
						web, however.</p>
				</div>
			</section>

			<section id="xml-conformance">
				<h3>XML conformance</h3>

				<p>The requirements for XML-based media types [[rfc2046]] defined in <a
						data-cite="epub-33#sec-xml-constraints">XML conformance</a> [[epub-33]] also apply to [=eBraille
					publications=].</p>

				<p>The only difference is that eBraille publications only support UTF-8 [[unicode]]. UTF-16 MUST NOT be
					used to encode XML resources.</p>
			</section>
		</section>
		<section id="ebrl-fileset">
			<h2>eBraille file set</h2>

			<section id="fileset-intro" class="informative">
				<h3>Introduction</h3>

				<p>The [=eBraille file set=] is like a physical manifestation of the <a
						data-cite="epub-33#sec-container-abstract">OCF abstract container</a> [[epub-33]]. EPUB 3 only
					defines its file set in the abstract because those files are expected to be zipped in the [=EPUB
					container=] [[epub-33]]; the standard is not concerned with the physical files before they are
					zipped or after they are unzipped. As a ZIP file does not have a true file system within it, the
					rules for file naming and placement can only be defined virtually.</p>

				<p>eBraille moves the rules for the OCF abstract container to the physical file set that exists before
					and after packaging in the EPUB container. This allows an [=eBraille publication=] to be independent
					of packaging, making it a format that can flexibly move between web deployment and end-user
					distribution.</p>

				<p>eBraille defines additional rules on the file structure in order to make it easier to read an
					eBraille publication on the web or from a local file system. In particular, it requires the [=EPUB
					navigation document=] [[epub-33]] be in the root of the file set and named <code>index.html</code>.
					These requirements do not conflict with being able to package an eBraille publication as a valid
					[=EPUB publication=] [[epub-33]], however.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="fileset-structure">
				<h3>File and directory structure</h3>

				<p>The [=eBraille file set=] MUST have a single common root directory &#8212; the [=publication root=]
					&#8212; for all the contents of the [=eBraille publication=].</p>

				<p>Unlike EPUB 3, the eBraille file set MUST NOT reference resources outside the publication root (i.e.,
					[=remote resources=] [[epub-33]] are not supported).</p>

				<p>The eBraille file set MUST contain the following files in the publication root:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>The <a data-cite="epub-33#sec-nav">EPUB navigation document</a> [[epub-33]]. This file MUST be
						named <code>index.html</code></li>
					<li>The <a data-cite="epub-33#sec-package-doc">EPUB package document</a> [[epub-33]]. This file MUST
						be named <code>package.opf</code></li>
				</ul>

				<p>There are no restrictions on where the rest of the eBraille publication content goes beyond the
					requirement in EPUB 3 that <a data-cite="epub-33#sec-container-file-and-dir-structure">publication
						resources are not allowed in a <code>META-INF</code> directory</a> [[epub-33]].</p>

				<div class="note">
					<p>For simplicity of unzipping and accessing a publication on a user's local file system, [=eBraille
						creators=] are encouraged to place the rest of the publication in a subfolder (e.g., named
							"<code>ebraille</code>"). This will make the navigation document the first HTML file users
						encounter.</p>
				</div>
			</section>

			<section id="fileset-naming">
				<h3>File paths and file names</h3>

				<p>To avoid potential naming issues when opening [=eBraille publications=] on common operating systems,
					eBraille file paths and file names MUST adhere to the EPUB 3 file naming restrictions specified in
						<a data-cite="epub-33#sec-container-filenames">File paths and file names</a> [[epub-33]].</p>
			</section>

			<section id="fileset-urls">
				<h3>URLs in the file set</h3>

				<p>Although the [=publication root=] establishes a common directory for all files in an [=eBraille
					publication=], depending on how the eBraille publication is deployed it could allow references to
					resolve outside of the publication root. For example, if an eBraille publication is deployed on the
					web, unless it assigned its own domain, a [=path-absolute-URL string=] [[url]] (i.e., a path that
					begins with a slash) could allow the publication to reach other resources on the server.</p>

				<p>For this reason, the eBraille file set MUST NOT include file references that use path-absolute-URL
					strings.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="multiple-renditions">
				<h3>Multiple renditions</h3>

				<p>An [=eBraille publication=] MAY contain multiple renditions of the content. The specifics of how this
					is done are defined in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-multi-rend-11/">EPUB 3 Multiple-Rendition
						Publications 1.1</a> [[epub-multi-rend-11]].</p>

				<p>When including multiple renditions, the <a data-cite="epub-multi-rend-11#container">default
						rendition</a> [[epub-multi-rend-11]] &#8212; the one listed first in the <a
						data-cite="epub-33#sec-container-metainf-container.xml"><code>container.xml</code> file</a>
					[[epub-33]] &#8212; MUST be a braille rendition. The default rendition has a default <a
						data-cite="epub-multi-rend-11#accessMode-attr"><code>rendition:accessMode</code> selection
						attribute</a> [[epub-multi-rend-11]] equivalent to the value <code>tactile</code>. No other
					value is allowed if the attribute is set explicitly.</p>

				<p>Subsequent renditions are exempt from the following requirements:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>The <a href="#fileset-structure">file naming and location requirements</a> for the package
						document and primary entry page, as this would cause conflicts.</li>

				<h3>Introduction</h3>

				<p>eBraille uses the EPUB 3 <a data-cite="epub-33#sec-package-doc">package document</a> [[epub-33]] to
					express information about an [=eBraille publication=].</p>

				<p>The package document is an XML document that contains three primary sections that encapsulate
					information about the content and how to render it:</p>

				<ul>
					<li><a href="#metadata">Metadata</a> &#8212; the <code>metadata</code> element contains
						bibliographic and rendering information about an eBraille publication.</li>
					<li><a href="#manifest">Manifest</a> &#8212; the <code>manifest</code> element contains a list of
						all the <a href="#ebrl-resources">publication resources</a>.</li>
					<li><a href="#spine">Spine</a> &#8212; the <code>spine</code> element contains the default ordering
						of [=eBraille content documents=].</li>
				</ul>

				<p>These sections are all contained within the <a href="#package-elem">root <code>package</code>
						element</a>.</p>

				<p>The primary difference of the eBraille package document is only in the metadata that is required and
					recommended. The eBraille implementation of the package document is also more limited in the
					features it allows &#8212; EPUB 3's <a data-cite="epub-33#sec-manifest-fallbacks">manifest
						fallbacks</a> and <a data-cite="epub-33#sec-pkg-legacy">legacy elements</a> [[epub-33]] are not
					allowed, for example.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="package-elem">
				<h3>The <code>package</code> element</h3>

				<p>At the root of the eBraille package document is the <code>package</code> element. This element MUST
					conform to the <a data-cite="epub-33#sec-package-elem">requirements for the <code>package</code>
						element</a> in [[epub-33]].</p>

				<p>For example, EPUB 3 requires the <code>package</code> element's <a
						data-cite="epub-33#attrdef-package-version"><code>version</code> attribute</a> [[epub-33]] have
					the value "<code>3.0</code>". This identifies that the package document conforms to the EPUB 3
					definition. (The identifier that the content conforms to this specification is contained in the
					required <a href="#dc:format"><code>dc:format</code> element</a>.)</p>

				<p>It is also required that the <code>unique-identifier</code> attribute [[epub-33]] be specified. This
					attribute references the ID of the <a href="#dc:identifier"><code>dc:identifier</code> element</a>
					that contains the unique identifier for the publication.</p>

				<p>Although setting the default language of the package document text on the <code>package</code>
					element is not required, it is best practice to set it here in an <a
						data-cite="epub-33#attrdef-xml-lang"><code>xml:lang</code> attribute</a> [[epub-33]] so that
					language information is available for every element that requires it.</p>

				<aside class="example" title="Typical package element attributes">
					<p>In this example, a <code>dc:identifier</code> element with the <code>id</code> attribute value
							<code>uid</code> (not shown) is specified in the metadata.</p>

							This element is the first child of the root <a href="#package-elem"><code>package</code>

						<p>EPUB 3 requires that all Dublin Core [[dcterms]] and <a href="#meta-elem"><code>meta</code>
								elements</a> have <a data-cite="epub-33#sec-metadata-values">child text content</a>
							[[epub-33]] (i.e., they have to have at least one non-whitespace character after <a
								data-cite="infra#strip-leading-and-trailing-ascii-whitespace">leading and trailing ASCII
								whitespace</a> [[?infra]] is stripped). In the descriptions for these elements, this
							specification refers to this content as the element's <dfn>value</dfn>.</p>

						<p>Whitespace within these element values is not significant. Sequences of one or more
							whitespace characters are <a data-cite="infra#strip-and-collapse-ascii-whitespace">collapsed
								to a single space</a> [[infra]] during processing.</p>

					<section id="meta-prefixes">
						<h4>Using prefixes</h4>

						<p>The <a href="#meta-elem"><code>meta</code> element</a> and <a href="#link-elem"
									><code>link</code> element</a> are meant for use with properties defined in existing
							metadata vocabularies, such as those in the Dublin Core <code>/terms/</code> namespace
							[[dcterms]].</p>

						<p>EPUB 3 defines a set of <a data-cite="epub-33#sec-reserved-prefixes">reserved prefixes</a>
							[[epub-33]] for common metadata vocabularies. Properties from these vocabularies can be used
							without having to declare their prefix.</p>

						<p>If properties from other vocabularies are needed, a prefix needs to be declared before they
							can be used. Prefixes are defined in the <code>prefix</code> attribute on the <a
								href="#package-elem">root <code>package</code> element</a>. Both the prefix and a URL to
							associate with the prefix have to be specified. These values are separated by
							whitespace.</p>

				<h3>Introduction</h3>

				<p>[=eBraille content documents=] define the markup and presentation of the content of an [=eBraille
					publication=]. An eBraille content document is encoded using the <a data-cite="html#">XML syntax</a>
					of [[html]], also commonly known as XHTML, and is styled using CSS [[css2]].</p>

				<p>eBraille content documents are not limited to formatted text. For example, they may include tactile
					graphics, audio, and video. The primary difference between the features of an eBraille content
					document and a typical web page is that scripting and forms are not supported.</p>

				<p>Note that unlike EPUB 3, eBraille only supports XHTML in the [=spine=] of an eBraille publication.
					SVG images are not supported in the [=spine=] but can be embedded in XHTML documents.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="xhtml">
				<h3>XHTML</h3>

				<p>An [=eBraille content document=] MUST be an <a data-cite="epub-33#sec-xhtml">XHTML content
						document</a> as defined [[epub-33]] with additional constraints as defined in the following
					subsections.</p>

				<section id="xhtml-char-encoding">
					<h4>Character encoding</h4>

					<p>[=eBraille content documents=] are required to provide their text content in 6- or 8-dot braille
						characters. eBraille is not meant as a delivery format for ASCII braille or similar mappings to
						braille cells.</p>

					<p>For this reason, the text content of [=eBraille content documents=] SHOULD consist only of the
						following [[unicode]] characters:</p>

					<ul>
						<li><a href="https://www.unicode.org/charts/nameslist/c_2800.html">Braille Patterns</a> (U+2800
							… U+28FF) ;</li>
						<li>Whitespace [[xml]]: <ul>
								<li>TAB (U+0009)</li>
								<li>LF (U+000A)</li>
								<li>CR (U+000D)</li>
								<li>SPACE (U+0020)</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>NO-BREAK SPACE (U+00A0)</li>
						<li>SOFT HYPHEN (U+00AD)</li>
					</ul>

					<div class="note">
						<p>The zero width space character is not included in this list as eBraille creators are advised
							to use the [^wbr^] element [[html]] to indicate break opportunities within words.</p>
					</div>

					<p>This restriction only applies to the renderable text of an XHTML document as well as the
						attributes that could be rendered depending on the display capabilities of a device or user
						configuration settings, for example:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>the [^img/alt^] attribute [[html]] for images and image maps that cannot be displayed;</li>
						<li>the [^th/abbr^] attribute [[html]] for alternative table headings;</li>
						<li>the [^abbr/title^] attribute [[html]] for expansions of abbreviations.</li>
					</ul>

					<p>This restriction does not apply to attributes that carry meta information (e.g., the
						[^global/class^] and [^a/href^] attributes [[html]], as well as the [^html-global/title^]
						attribute in <a href="#page-list">the page list</a>).</p>

					<div class="note">
						<p>For some technologies that can be embedded in eBraille content documents, such as [[mathml]],
							it will not be possible to restrict the text to braille characters.</p>
					</div>
				</section>

				<section id="xhtml-no-support">
					<h4>Unsupported features</h4>

					<p>eBraille does not support scripted interactivity or form submissions. Consequently, [=eBraille
						creators=] MUST NOT include [[html]] [^script^] elements or the [^form^] element's
						[^form/action^] attribute in <a>eBraille content documents</a>.</p>

					<div class="note">
						<p>The lack of support for scripting means that html elements that depend on scripting (e.g.,

					<h4>Introduction</h4>

					<p>[=eBraille creators=] may use CSS [[css2]] to style and lay out [=content documents=]. With the
						few exceptions defined in this section, eBraille defers to [[epub-33]], and more specifically to
						the CSS standardization work done in <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr>, to
						define CSS.</p>

					<div class="note">
						<p>Keep in mind that some [=reading systems=] will not support all desired features of CSS. The

							<li>The "<a data-cite="css-page#">CSS Paged Media Module Level 3</a>" working draft
								[[css-page]], which builds on the "<a data-cite="css2/page.html#the-page">Paged
									media</a>" section of [[css2]], is not well supported in web browsers.</li>
						</ul>
					</div>

					<p>Note that the presentation of content is not determined by author style sheets only. Reading
						systems are expected to apply default styles that make sense for the current locale, in case
						author styles are missing or incomplete. This may be done through CSS or through other means.
						Reading systems may also perform specific styling according to user preferences.</p>

					<p>In addition, eBraille creators:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>SHOULD NOT use properties that affect the text's font (e.g., which font gets applied, its
								size, whether it is bold, italic, etc.). Creators should assume that reading systems
								determine the shape and size of the braille symbols (e.g., for technical reasons, or to
								ensure a good reading experience).</p>

				<section id="media-queries">
					<h4>Media queries</h4>

					<p>eBraille allows the use of media queries [[mediaqueries]] to support styling and content that is
						conditional on the type and characteristics of the device.</p>

					<p>The restrictions and recommendations in this section apply to CSS (e.g. <a
							data-cite="css-conditional#at-media"><code>@media</code></a> [[css-conditional]] and <a
							data-cite="css-cascade#conditional-import"><code>@import</code></a> [[css-cascade]] rules),
						as well as where <a data-cite="html#mq">media queries are used as a microsyntax in</a> [[html]]
						(such as in the <a data-cite="html#the-link-element"><code>link</code></a> and <a
							data-cite="html#the-style-element"><code>style</code></a> elements), and in <a
							data-cite="xml-stylesheet#"><code>xml-stylesheet</code></a> processing instructions
						[[xml-stylesheet]].</p>

					<p>[=eBraille creators=] SHOULD NOT use media queries that discriminate between a braille display
						and a screen when the target medium is a braille display.</p>

					<div class="note">
						<p>The logical consequence of this is that it will be impossible to discriminate between visual
							and tactile access modes. In other words, it forces rendering on a screen and on a braille
							display, that are otherwise comparable, to be the same, and the CSS to have the same
							requirements.</p>

						<p>The use of <a data-cite="mediaqueries#valdef-media-braille"><code>braille</code></a>, and <a
								data-cite="mediaqueries#grid"><code>(grid)</code></a> is not recommended because there
							are currently no known CSS implementations that match these types, so requiring [=eBraille
							reading systems=] to match them could be problematic. <!-- Another reason to not
									recommend <code>braille</code> is because it is expected to become
									deprecated.--></p>

						<p>Using <a data-cite="mediaqueries#valdef-media-screen"><code>screen</code></a> is also not
							recommended to be forward-compatible with a possible future version of the standard that
							supports differences in styling for screens vs. braille displays.</p>

				<h3>Authoring best practices</h3>

				<p>As this is a technical specification for the eBraille format, its focus is on the technologies for
					creating [=eBraille content documents=]. It does not specify a specific manner in which the content
					must be created, as regional differences in braille codes will influence how any given publication
					is formatted.</p>

				<p>A goal of the eBraille format, however, is, as much as possible, to promote common markup practices
					across regions so that organizations and individuals can interchange files without needing to
					completely reformat them. Using common markup practices will allow [=eBraille reading systems=] to
					apply regional CSS rules, improving the readability for users expecting different braille formatting
					conventions.</p>

				<p>To this end, eBraille content documents rely primarily on the [[html]] [^global/class^] and [^/role^]
					attributes to identify formatting requirements. Augmenting core HTML elements with a common set of
					classes and roles will make eBraille publications more predictable for reformatting.</p>

				<p>The eBraille working group is working on a set of best practices to help facilitate this model. These
					include:</p>

				<ul>
					<li><a href="best-practices/tagging/">eBraille Tagging Best Practices</a> &#8212; This document

			<h2>Primary entry page</h2>

			<section id="navdoc-intro" class="informative">
				<h3>Introduction</h3>

				<p>To make it easier to deploy [=eBraille publications=] on the web, the [=EPUB navigation document=] is
					used as the primary entry point for publications. The required file naming (<code>index.html</code>)
					and location of this file mean it will be the first document loaded when users browse to a folder
					containing an eBraille publication.</p>

				<p>By requiring the [=primary entry page=] be located in the [=publication root=], it is also easier for
					users to unzip an eBraille publication and read it locally, if they so choose. If all the other
					resources in the publication are placed in a subfolder, for example, the primary entry page will be
					the first HTML document users encounter in the unzipped folder.</p>

				<p>The primary entry page does not have to be the first document in the <a href="#spine">spine</a>,
					however. As the page is meant as an entryway for web reading, it may not be helpful to include it in
					the spine at all. Reading systems will still be able to extract the table of contents and other
					information from the document even if it is not in the spine.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="nav-req">
				<h3>General requirements</h3>

				<p>The primary entry page MUST be a conforming <a data-cite="epub-33#sec-nav">EPUB navigation
						document</a> [[epub-33]]. In addition, it MUST be named <code>index.html</code> and be located
					in the [=publication root=], as defined in <a href="#fileset-structure"></a>.</p>

				<p>The primary entry page MUST include an [[html]] [^link^] element with its [^link/rel^] attribute set
					to the value <code>publication</code>. The [^link/href^] attribute MUST specify the package document
					and the [^link/type^] attribute MUST contain the media type of the package document
						(<code>application/oebps-package+xml</code>).</p>

				<aside class="example" title="Publication link in the primary entry page">
					<pre><code>&lt;html &#8230;>
   &lt;head>
      &#8230;
      &lt;link rel="publication" href="package.opf" type="application/oebps-package+xml"/>
      &#8230;
   &lt;/head>
   &lt;body>
      &#8230;
   &lt;/body>
&lt;/html></code></pre>
				</aside>

				<p>Although it is possible to discover the package document by its required name and location, this
					requirement ensures that [=eBraille reading systems=] can programmatically determine that the
					primary entry page belongs to an [=eBraille publication=] (i.e., to avoid having to check for a
					package document for any web page a user might try to open).</p>

				<p>The primary entry page MAY include [[html]] [^script^] elements only if the document is not included
					in the spine. This exception is to allow publishers to include a user interface to better enable
					reading of their publication in browsers. It is not meant for general scripting of the content.</p>

				<div class="note">
					<p>A scripted primary entry page is not allowed in the spine as an extra measure to ensure that the
						scripting does not interfere with rendering in [=eBraille reading systems=]. Reading systems are
						expected to disable the scripting in the primary entry page regardless of the document's
						placement in the spine.</p>
				</div>

				<p>As the primary entry page is meant to help browser users navigate the publication, it SHOULD NOT be
					included in the <a href="#spine">spine</a>. If the publication needs a table of contents in the
					spine, it is better to create a separate document with publication-specific formatting.</p>

				<p>As per the requirements of EPUB 3, the <a href="#manifest">manifest entry</a> for the primary entry
					page has to have a <code>properties</code> attribute with the value <code>nav</code>
					[[epub-33]].</p>

					<h4>Table of contents</h4>

					<p>The table of contents provides users access to the major sections of the publications.</p>

					<p>The EPUB 3 specification requires that the table of contents be defined in an [[html]] [^nav^]
						element whose <a data-cite="epub-33#dfn-epub-type"><code>epub:type</code> attribute</a>
						specifies the value "<a data-cite="epub-33#sec-nav-toc"><code>toc</code></a>" [[epub-33]].</p>

					<p>For compatibility with web-based rendering, the table of contents MUST also be identified by the
						[^/role^] attribute [[html]] value "<a data-cite="dpub-aria#doc-toc"><code>doc-toc</code></a>"
						[[dpub-aria]].</p>

					<aside class="example" title="Table of contents identified by the epub:type and role attributes">

&lt;/html></pre>
					</aside>

					<p>The table of contents is defined by a single [[html]] ordered list ([^ol^]) in the root of the
							<code>nav</code> element. Each [[html]] list item ([^li^]) represents one of the top-level
						sections of the publication. If the section can be linked to, wrap its heading inside an
						[[html]] anchor tag ([^a^]), otherwise wrap the heading in a [^span^] element (unlinked headings
						are not common outside of publications that omit content).</p>

					<aside class="example" title="Table of contents for a novel with only chapter headings">
						<pre>&lt;nav epub:type="toc"

					<p>If a section contains additional subsections, list those headings in an <code>ol</code> element
						after the link to the heading.</p>

					<p>The minimalist rules on the structure of the table of contents are to ensure that [=eBraille

			<h2>Media overlays</h2>

			<p>eBraille publications support <a data-cite="epub-33##sec-media-overlays">media overlays</a> as defined in

			<p>At the same time, it is possible to create eBraille publications that fail to meet the needs of users if

			<p>Packaged eBraille publications use the same media type identifier as EPUB in the <code>mimetype</code>

				<h3>Threat model</h3>

				<p>Although eBraille shares a common file set with EPUB 3, many of the <a
						data-cite="epub-33#sec-security-privacy">privacy and security threats</a> [[epub-33]] that arise
					with EPUB 3 publications do not apply to [=eBraille publications=]. The reason is that the primary
					threat vectors in EPUB 3 come from its allowance of scripting and network access. Users do not face
					the same risks from third party scripts, from attempts by publishers to monitor their activities or
					profile them through scripting, or from malicious code being brought in by remote resource calls,
					among other threats outlined in EPUB 3.</p>

				<p>It does not mean that there are no security or privacy risks with eBraille publications. [=eBraille
					creators=] still need to ensure they maintain the security and privacy rights of users when creating
					their publications. The possible areas of concern for eBraille publications include:</p>

				<dl>
					<dt>Linking to external resources</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>Linking out to resources on the web can expose users to potential malicious content.
							Broken-link hijacking is one example where a malicious actor may buy the expired domain of a
							site and redirect users to content the eBraille creator never intended. Links to a
							publishers web site could allow them to profile users if they include tracking
							information.</p>
					</dd>

					<dt>Including malicious content</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>Although eBraille does not allow eBraille creators to embed remote resources in publications,
							using third-party resources, such as tactile graphics, can expose users to exploits.</p>
					</dd>

					<dt>Falsified publication information</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>Malicious actors could include false metadata &#8212; such as the title, author, and
							publisher &#8212; in an eBraille publication to trick unsuspecting users into believing they
							are reading material from a trustworthy source. This could, for example, lead users to be
							more trusting of external links than they otherwise would be.</p>

			<h2>eBraille Reading Systems</h2>

			<section id="rs-intro" class="informative">
				<h3>Introduction</h3>

				<p>As an [=eBraille publication=] represents a subset of an <a data-cite="epub-33#sec-epub-conf">EPUB 3
						publication</a> [[epub-33]], an eBraille reading system similarly consists of a subset of
					features of a full <a data-cite="epub-rs-33#sec-rs-conformance">EPUB 3 reading system</a>
					[[epub-rs-33]].</p>

				<p>Similar to EPUB 3, eBraille does not define a uniform set of requirements that all reading systems
					must meet. Support is instead based on the capabilities of the device. A reading system might not
					support <a href="#ebrl-mo">media overlays</a>, for example, if it does not support audio
					playback.</p>

				<p>As eBraille publications can be deployed unpackaged on the web, users may not even require a
					dedicated eBraille reading system to read them. A very basic reading experience will be possible
					directly from a standard web browser, while browser-based reading systems could provide a richer
					reading experience for reading on the web.</p>

					<h4>Other unsupported features</h4>

					<p>The following EPUB reading system features [[epub-rs-33]] are not supported in the authoring of
						eBraille publications. Unlike the features restricted in <a href="#rs-req-epub"></a>, the
						existence of these features will not affect the rendering of [=eBraille publications=] and does
						not affect their privacy or security. Reading systems built on EPUB rendering engines MAY
						support these features although they SHOULD be disabled, if possible, to discourage use by

							EPUB versions.</li>
					</ul>

					<p>eBraille reading systems not built on EPUB rendering engines MUST NOT add support for these
						features.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h4>Publication types</h4>

					<p>An eBraille reading system MUST support at least one of <a href="#ebrl-packaging">packaged
							eBraille publications</a> or <a href="#ebrl-web-deploy">web-hosted eBraille
						publications</a>, but SHOULD support both deployment methods.</p>

					<p>For packaged eBraille publications, reading systems:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>SHOULD NOT fail to open a publication solely because the <code>mimetype</code> is missing or
							not encoded or stored as required.</li>
						<li>are not required to <a data-cite="epub-rs-33#sec-container-iri">assign a unique URL</a>
							[[epub-rs-33]] to publications because scripting is not supported. It is still RECOMMENDED
							to domain isolate publications in case scripting is introduced in a future version,
							however.</li>
					</ul>

					<p>If an eBraille reading system supports web access, it SHOULD allow users to download unpackaged
						eBraille publications hosted on the web by specifying the path to the package document.</p>
				</section>

				<section id="rs-req-fonts">
					<h4>Font support</h4>

					<p>In addition to the general requirements for CSS support in [[epub-rs-33]], Reading devices MUST
						guarantee that <code>1ch</code> corresponds with the cell-to-cell distance (i.e., the distance
						from center to center of corresponding dots in adjacent cells), while <code>1em</code> should
						correspond with the line-to-line distance (i.e., the distance from center to center of
						corresponding dots from one line to the next).</p>

					<p>As the <a href="#css-req">use of CSS font properties</a> is not recommended, reading system
						support for <a data-cite="epub-rs-33#sec-container-fobfus">font obfuscation</a> is OPTIONAL.</p>

				<section id="rs-mq">
					<h4>Media queries</h4>

					<p>[=eBraille reading systems=] of type braille display MUST match either <code>braille</code> or
							<code>screen</code>, and SHOULD match both. They SHOULD match both <code>(grid)</code> and
							<code>not (grid)</code>.</p>

					<div class="ednote">
						<p>[[mediaqueries]] deprecates <a data-cite="mediaqueries#valdef-media-braille"

								"<em>SHOULD match <code>screen</code></em>".</p>
					</div>
				</section>

				<section id="rs-req-cmt">
					<h4>Core media types</h4>

					<p>eBraille reading systems MUST support PDF for tactile graphics in addition to the core media
						types requirements in [[epub-rs-33]]. If an eBraille reading system is not capable of rendering

				<p>Browser-based reading systems will be inherently less secure than dedicated eBraille reading systems,

				<h3>The <code>application/ebrl+zip</code> media type</h3>

				<p>This appendix registers the media type <code>application/ebrl+zip</code> for the eBraille
					implementation of the EPUB Open Container Format (OCF).</p>

				<p>The OCF ZIP container file is based on the zip archive format (see <a
						href="https://pkware.cachefly.net/webdocs/casestudies/APPNOTE.TXT"
						>https://pkware.cachefly.net/webdocs/casestudies/APPNOTE.TXT</a>). It is used to encapsulate an
					eBraille publication.</p>

				<dl class="variablelist">
					<dt>MIME media type name:</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>
							<code>application</code>
						</p>
					</dd>

					<dt>MIME subtype name:</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>
							<code>ebrl+zip</code>
						</p>

					<dt>Required parameters:</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>None.</p>
					</dd>

					<dt>Optional parameters:</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>None.</p>
					</dd>

					<dt>Encoding considerations:</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>OCF ZIP container files are binary files encoded in the <a class="media-type"
								href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/application/zip">
								<code>application/zip</code></a> media type.</p>
					</dd>

					<dt>Security considerations:</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>All processors that read OCF ZIP container files should rigorously check the size and
							validity of data retrieved.</p>
						<p>In addition, because of the various content types that can be embedded in OCF ZIP container
							files, <code>application/ebrl+zip</code> may describe content that poses security
							implications beyond those noted here. However, only in cases where the processor recognizes
							and processes the additional content, or where further processing of that content is
							dispatched to other processors, would security issues potentially arise. In such cases,
							matters of security would fall outside the domain of this registration document.</p>
						<p>Security considerations that apply to <code>application/zip</code> also apply to OCF ZIP
							container files.</p>
					</dd>

					<dt>Interoperability considerations:</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>None.</p>
					</dd>

					<dt>Published specification:</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>This media type registration is for the eBraille implementation of the EPUB Open Container
							Format (OCF), as described by the eBraille specification located at <a
								href="https://www.daisy.org/s/eBraille"
								><code>https://www.daisy.org/s/eBraille</code></a>.</p>
					</dd>

					<dt>Applications that use this media type:</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>This media type is in use for the distribution of braille documents in the eBraille
							format.</p>
					</dd>
