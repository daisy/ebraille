			<div data-include="common/status.html" data-include-replace="true"></div>
			<p>The eBraille Working Group is seeking input on all aspects of this document. It is particularly
				interested in implementation experience both creating eBraille publication and creating reading systems
				in which to read them.</p>
		</section>
		<section id="intro">
			<h2>Introduction</h2>

			<section id="overview">
				<h3>Overview</h3>

				<p>Unlike braille formats that focus on interchanging embosser-ready braille, eBraille focuses on
					adapting braille for reading in refreshable braille displays with different line lengths.</p>

				<p>In order to maintain close alignment with mainstream publishing formats, and simplify transcription
					of these works, the eBraille format is built on an EPUB 3-compatible file set &#8212; it
					incorporates XHTML documents, CSS, images, audio, and video. This means that an [=eBraille
					publication=] shares its technology with the web, making it compatible for reading in standard web
					browsers.</p>

				<p>An [=eBraille publication=] differs from reading a typical web site in that the braille is not
					transformed on the fly but comes formatted according to the rules of the regional braille code where
					the publication was produced. But users are not locked into the default display. With the display
					flexibility of CSS, and standardized markup practices, they could apply styles for another region or
					even modify the display to their own preferences (e.g., by changing the maximum line length).</p>

				<p>eBraille publications are also designed to be flexible for deployment. An eBraille publication can be
					placed on the web, unzipped on a user's local file system, or distributed in EPUB 3-compatible
					packaging. And as web-compatible file sets, they are adaptable to future changes to publishing
					formats.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="relationship-epub3" class="informative">
				<h3>Relationship to EPUB 3</h3>

				<p>The [=eBraille file set=] is designed to be compatible with EPUB 3 [[epub-33]] and adapt to changes
					to that standard. Distribution and consumption on mainstream [=EPUB reading systems=], however, is
					not a primary goal of this format. This specification introduces some additional requirements and
					features beyond those defined in EPUB 3, and it is not expected that mainstream reading systems will
					adapt to these modifications. Consequently, an eBraille publication may not render exactly as
					intended outside of eBraille reading systems.</p>

				<p>The primary difference between the eBraille format and EPUB 3 is eBraille publications do not have to
					be packaged and distributed in an [=EPUB container=] [[epub-33]]. An [=eBraille publication=] will
					be easy to package in an EPUB container when needed, however.</p>

				<p>Compatibility with EPUB 3 also means that eBraille relies on the same <a
						data-cite="epub-33#sec-intro-relations">underlying technologies</a> [[epub-33]]. Many of these
					technologies, like [[html]], are referred to as "evergreen" or "living" standards as they are
					updated often and they do not have version numbers. Others, like [[svg]], are referred to without a
					specific version number so that the latest recommendation is always the recommended one to use.</p>

				<p>The practical effect of this approach is predominantly beneficial for [=eBraille creators=]. New
					features become available for use as soon as they are standardized, without having to wait for the
					eBraille standard to catch up. It does come with some drawbacks, however. eBraille creators also
					have to keep themselves apprised of changes to the underlying technologies, and use their best
					judgement in some cases as to whether a new feature is supported well enough in [=eBraille reading
					systems=] to begin deploying. In some rare cases, it may also mean that content that was previously
					valid may no longer be, but breaking changes like this usually only happen when features are
					unsupported or are found to have serious security or privacy flaws.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="future-dir" class="informative">
				<h3>Future directions</h3>

				<p>The first version of the eBraille format is focused on creating a reading experience that is
					minimally feature complete for the majority of braille publications. It is not expected that this
					version will handle every unique formatting requirement of every publication type, but future drafts
					and versions of this specification will focus on making the format more feature complete.</p>

				<p>In particular, the working group expects to review the current support decisions for the following
					features:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>scripting &#8212; the use of JavaScript in [=eBraille content documents=] is currently
						prohibited. The working group is seeking further input on the need for dynamic braille before
						allowing scripting as the ability to script documents increases the security and privacy risks
						of the format.</li>
					<li>CSS extensions &#8212; the first version of eBraille uses standard CSS properties to format
						braille content. There may be a need to extend CSS in the future to handle more complex
						formatting cases, which will also require defining reading system implementations.</li>
					<li>embossing &#8212; this version of eBraille is focused on consuming [=eBraille publications=] on
						electronic reading systems, more specifically refreshable braille displays. It is expected that
						a revision is needed to better account for the use case of embossing publications on paper.</li>
				</ul>

			<p>The rest of this specification covers specific conformance details.</p>
		</section>
		<section id="ebrl-resources">
			<h2>Publication resources</h2>

			<section id="res-intro" class="informative">
				<h3>Introduction</h3>

				<p>An [=eBraille publication=] is typically composed of many resources &#8212; XHTML documents, CSS
					files, tactile graphics, audio, video, etc.</p>

				<p>As an eBraille publication is intended to be easily packaged as a conforming [=EPUB publication=],
					the requirements for publication resources are inherited from EPUB, specifically as defined in <a
						data-cite="epub-33#sec-publication-resources"></a> [[epub-33]].</p>

				<p>This section represents a subsetting of the EPUB requirements, as certain features, such as manifest
					fallbacks, are disallowed in eBraille publications.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="cmt">
				<h3>Core media types</h3>

				<p>To ensure that [=eBraille reading systems=] are capable of rendering the content of [=eBraille
					publications=], only certain widely supported resource types are allowed to be included without
					fallbacks. These are called core media types and are designated by their MIME media type [[rfc2046]]
					(e.g., XHTML documents have the MIME media type <code>application/xhtml+xml</code>.</p>

				<p>Being designated a core media type does not mean that all reading systems are required to support the
					type of resource, however. A reading system without audio capabilities will not be able to render
					audio core media types, for example.</p>

				<p>The list of core media types allowed in eBraille publications is the same as those designated for
					EPUB 3. Some of the key core media types for eBraille include:</p>

				<ul>
					<li><code>application/xhtml+xml</code> &#8212; HTML documents that use the XML syntax [[html]].</li>
					<li><code>text/css</code> &#8212; CSS Style Sheets [[css2]].</li>
					<li><code>image/jpeg</code> &#8212; JPEG Images [[jpeg]]</li>
					<li><code>image/png</code> &#8212; PNG Images [[png]]</li>
					<li><code>image/svg+xml</code> &#8212; SVG images [[svg]]</li>
				</ul>

				<p>The complete list is available in the <a data-cite="epub-33#sec-core-media-types">core media types
						section</a> of [[epub-33]].</p>

				<p>All other media types are considered <a href="foreign-res">foreign resources</a>.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="foreign-res">
				<h3>Foreign resources</h3>

				<p>Foreign resources, unlike <a href="#cmt">core media types</a>, have no guarantee of support in
					reading systems.</p>

				<p>To avoid users not being able to access the content of the [=eBraille publication=], foreign
					resources can only be used if a fallback to a core media type is provided. Fallbacks are provided
					using <a data-cite="epub-33#sec-intrinsic-fallbacks">intrinsic fallback methods</a> [[epub-33]].</p>

				<div class="note">
					<p><a href="#fallbacks">Manifest fallbacks</a> are not supported in eBraille, so foreign resources
						cannot be used in the <a href="#spine">spine</a>. Similarly, foreign image formats have to
						include fallbacks using the [[html]] [^img^] and [^picture^] elements' intrinsic fallback
						capabilities.</p>
				</div>

				<p>It is generally best to avoid foreign resources unless absolutely necessary. PDF tactile graphics are
					an example of a foreign resource that may not be avoidable for some EPUB creators, but using the
					[[html]] [^object^] element's intrinsic fallback capabilities can avoid having to duplicate the
					image in a core media type format.</p>

				<aside class="example" title="PDF tactile image with fallback">
					<pre>&lt;object
     data="ebraille/images/clouds.pdf"
     type="application/pdf"
     height="250"
     width="100"
     aria-labelledby="alt">
   &lt;p id="alt">&lt;!-- alternative text -->&lt;/p>
&lt;/object></pre>
				</aside>
			</section>

			<section id="fallbacks">
				<h3>Resource fallbacks</h3>

				<p>[=eBraille publications=] only support [=XHTML content documents=] in the [=spine=] [[epub-33]].
					Consequently, the use of <a data-cite="epub-33#sec-manifest-fallbacks">manifest fallbacks</a>
					[[epub-33]] is not supported.</p>

				<p>The intrinsic fallback methods provided by [[html]] elements are supported.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="res-location">
				<h3>Resource location</h3>

				<p>[=eBraille publications=] do not support [=remote resources=] [[epub-33]]. All publication resources
					MUST be located in or below the [=root directory=], as defined in <a href="#fileset-structure"
					></a>.</p>

				<p>eBraille does not support the <code>file:</code> URL scheme [[rfc8089]] for referencing resources in
					an eBraille publication. Accessing files on the user's local file system presents too great a
					security risk.</p>

				<p>The <code>data:</code> URL scheme MAY be used to embed resources within [=eBraille content
					documents=] per the restrictions outlined in <a data-cite="epub-33#sec-data-urls">Data URLs</a>
					[[epub-33]].</p>
			</section>

			<section id="res-exemptions" class="informative">
				<h3>Exempt resources</h3>

				<p>Note that it is possible to include additional resources in an [=eBraille publication=] that are not
					part of the rendering of the content. EPUB 3 defines resources that are not used in the [=spine=] or
					embedded in [=xhtml content documents=] as exempt from the normal [=core media type resource=]
					restrictions [[epub-33]].</p>

				<p>This means, for example, that [=eBraille creators=] can embed pre-formatted braille in their
					publication in a format such as PDF or BRF. The resource would still be listed in the [=manifest=],
					but it would not be flagged as needing a fallback.</p>

				<p>It would not be possible to link to these resources from the eBraille publication, but the
					publication could note the presence of the resources and include instructions on how to access them
					(e.g., to open the publication with a ZIP tool and navigate to a specific directory).</p>
			</section>

			<section id="res-extensions" class="informative">
				<h3>File extensions</h3>

				<p>Reading systems typically do not rely on file extensions for rendering, so, with a couple of notable
					exceptions for the <a href="#ebrl-package-doc">package document</a> and <a href="#ebrl-nav">primary
						entry page</a>, eBraille does not require specific extensions for the resources in an [=eBraille
					publication=]. The media type declared in the manifest is used as a hint to the nature of each
					resource, but even that declaration is not reliable. Instead, reading systems typically leave
					inspection of resources and their rendering to their underlying browser core.</p>

				<p>The use of standard file extensions for resources should still be considered a best practice,
					however, as it avoids authoring confusion over the nature of resources.</p>

				<p>Some formats have more than one common extension. For example, XHTML documents can use either the
					extension <code>.html</code> or <code>.xhtml</code> and JPEG images can use either <code>.jpg</code>
					or <code>.jpeg</code>. In these cases, either extension is acceptable.</p>

				<div class="note">
					<p>This specification uses the <code>.html</code> extension in examples for [=eBraille content
						documents=] as it is more widely used and recognized than <code>.xhtml</code>, particularly for
						opening the primary entry page.</p>

					<p>The <code>.xhtml</code> extension may be useful if eBraille content documents are opened in a
						browser on a local file system (e.g., for testing), as this triggers some browsers to render the
						content using the correct XML parser. It has no effect on documents served over the web,
						however.</p>
				</div>
			</section>

			<section id="xml-conformance">
				<h3>XML conformance</h3>

				<p>The requirements for XML-based media types [[rfc2046]] defined in <a
						data-cite="epub-33#sec-xml-constraints">XML conformance</a> [[epub-33]] also apply to [=eBraille
					publications=].</p>

				<p>The only difference is that eBraille publications only support UTF-8 [[unicode]]. UTF-16 MUST NOT be
					used to encode XML resources.</p>
			</section>
		</section>
		<section id="ebrl-fileset">
			<h2>eBraille file set</h2>

			<section id="fileset-intro" class="informative">
				<h3>Introduction</h3>

				<p>The [=eBraille file set=] is like a physical manifestation of the <a
						data-cite="epub-33#sec-container-abstract">OCF abstract container</a> [[epub-33]]. EPUB 3 only
					defines its file set in the abstract because those files are expected to be zipped in the [=EPUB
					container=] [[epub-33]]; the standard is not concerned with the physical files before they are
					zipped or after they are unzipped. As a ZIP file does not have a true file system within it, the
					rules for file naming and placement can only be defined virtually.</p>

				<p>eBraille moves the rules for the OCF abstract container to the physical file set that exists before
					and after packaging in the EPUB container. This allows an [=eBraille publication=] to be independent
					of packaging, making it a format that can flexibly move between web deployment and end-user
					distribution.</p>

				<p>eBraille defines additional rules on the file structure in order to make it easier to read an
					eBraille publication on the web or from a local file system. In particular, it requires the [=EPUB
					navigation document=] [[epub-33]] be in the root of the file set and named <code>index.html</code>.
					These requirements do not conflict with being able to package an eBraille publication as a valid
					[=EPUB publication=] [[epub-33]], however.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="fileset-structure">
				<h3>File and directory structure</h3>

				<p>The [=eBraille file set=] MUST have a single common root directory &#8212; the [=publication root=]
					&#8212; for all the contents of the [=eBraille publication=].</p>

				<p>Unlike EPUB 3, the eBraille file set MUST NOT reference resources outside the publication root (i.e.,
					[=remote resources=] [[epub-33]] are not supported).</p>

				<p>The eBraille file set MUST contain the following files in the publication root:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>The <a data-cite="epub-33#sec-nav">EPUB navigation document</a> [[epub-33]]. This file MUST be
						named <code>index.html</code></li>
					<li>The <a data-cite="epub-33#sec-package-doc">EPUB package document</a> [[epub-33]]. This file MUST
						be named <code>package.opf</code></li>
				</ul>

				<p>There are no restrictions on where the rest of the eBraille publication content goes beyond the
					requirement in EPUB 3 that <a data-cite="epub-33#sec-container-file-and-dir-structure">publication
						resources are not allowed in a <code>META-INF</code> directory</a> [[epub-33]].</p>

				<div class="note">
					<p>For simplicity of unzipping and accessing a publication on a user's local file system, [=eBraille
						creators=] are encouraged to place the rest of the publication in a subfolder (e.g., named
							"<code>ebraille</code>"). This will make the navigation document the first HTML file users
						encounter.</p>
				</div>
			</section>

			<section id="fileset-naming">
				<h3>File paths and file names</h3>

				<p>eBraille file paths and file names MUST adhere to the file naming restrictions specified in <a
						data-cite="epub-33#sec-container-filenames">section 4.2.3</a> of [[epub-33]].</p>
			</section>

			<section id="fileset-urls">
				<h3>URLs in the file set</h3>

				<p>Although the [=publication root=] establishes a common directory for all files in an [=eBraille
					publication=], depending on how the eBraille publication is deployed it could allow references to
					resolve outside of the publication root. For example, if an eBraille publication is deployed on the
					web, unless it assigned its own domain, a [=path-absolute-URL string=] [[url]] (i.e., a path that
					begins with a slash) could allow the publication to reach other resources on the server.</p>

				<p>For this reason, the eBraille file set MUST NOT include file references that use path-absolute-URL
					strings.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="multiple-renditions">
				<h3>Multiple renditions</h3>

				<p>An [=eBraille publication=] MAY contain multiple renditions of the content. The specifics of how this
					is done are defined in EPUB 3 Multiple-Rendition Publications 1.1 [[epub-multi-rend-11]].</p>

				<p>When including multiple renditions, only the <a data-cite="epub-multi-rend-11##container">default
						rendition</a> [[epub-multi-rend-11]] (i.e., one listed first in the <a
						data-cite="epub-33#sec-container-metainf-container.xml"><code>container.xml</code> file</a>
					[[epub-33]]) is subject to the <a href="#fileset-structure">file naming and location
						requirements</a> for the package document and primary entry page.</p>

				<p>The default rendition MUST be a braille rendition (i.e., identified by a <a
						data-cite="epub-multi-rend-11#accessMode-attr"><code>rendition:accessMode</code> attribute</a>
					with the value <code>tactile</code> [[epub-multi-rend-11]]).</p>

				<div class="note">
					<p>[[epub-multi-rend-11]] is only a W3C Working Group Note. The technology is not currently
						considered stable and should be used with appropriate caution.</p>

		<section id="ebrl-package-doc">
			<h2>Package Document</h2>

			<section id="package-doc-intro" class="informative">
				<h3>Introduction</h3>

				<p>eBraille uses the EPUB 3 <a data-cite="epub-33#sec-package-doc">package document</a> [[epub-33]] to
					express information about an [=eBraille publication=].</p>

				<p>The package document contains three primary sections:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Metadata &#8212; the <a href="#metadata"><code>metadata</code> element</a> contains
						bibliographic and rendering information about an eBraille publication.</li>
					<li>Manifest &#8212; the <a href="#manifest"><code>manifest</code> element</a> contains a list of
						all the publication resources.</li>
					<li>Spine &#8212; the <a href="#spine"><code>spine</code></a> element contains the default ordering
						of eBraille content documents.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>The primary difference of the eBraille package document is only in the metadata that is required and
					recommended. The eBraille implementation of the package document is also more limited in the
					features it allows &#8212; manifest fallbacks and legacy element are not allowed, for example.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="metadata">
				<h3>Metadata</h3>

				<section id="meta-about" class="informative">

						<h4>Metadata elements</h4>

						<p>The following elements are allowed in the package document metadata:</p>

						<dl>
							<dt>Dublin Core elements</dt>
							<dd>
								<p>Dublin Core defines 15 core elements in the <code>/elements/1.1/</code> namespace
									[[dcterms]] that can be used anywhere in the package document. Elements not in the

						<p>EPUB 3 requires that all Dublin Core [[dcterms]] and <code>meta</code> elements have <a
								data-cite="epub-33#sec-metadata-values">child text content</a> [[epub-33]] (i.e., they
							have to have at least one non-whitespace character after <a
								data-cite="infra#strip-leading-and-trailing-ascii-whitespace">leading and trailing ASCII
								whitespace</a> [[?infra]] is stripped). In the descriptions for these elements, this
							specification refers to this content as the element's <dfn>value</dfn>.</p>

						<p>Whitespace within these element values is not significant. Sequences of one or more
							whitespace characters are <a data-cite="infra#strip-and-collapse-ascii-whitespace">collapsed
								to a single space</a> [[infra]] during processing.</p>

						<h4>Using prefixes</h4>

						<p>The <code>meta</code> and <code>link</code> elements are meant for use with properties
							defined in existing metadata vocabularies, such as those in the Dublin Core
								<code>/terms/</code> namespace [[dcterms]].</p>

						<p>EPUB 3 defines a set of <a data-cite="epub-33#sec-reserved-prefixes">reserved prefixes</a>
							[[epub-33]] for common metadata vocabularies. Properties from these vocabularies can be used
							without having to declare their prefix.</p>

						<p>If properties from other vocabularies are needed, a prefix needs to be declared before they
							can be used. Prefixes are defined in the <code>prefix</code> attribute on the root
								<code>package</code> element. Both the prefix and a URL to associate with the prefix
							have to be specified.</p>

						<aside class="example" title="Declaring a new prefix">
							<pre>&lt;package &#8230; prefix="ex: https://example.com/metadata/">

				<p>eBraille content documents are not only formatted text. For example, they may include tactile

						Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> to define CSS.</p>

					<div class="note">
						<p>Keep in mind that some <a>reading systems</a> will not support all desired features of CSS.

					<p>Note that the presentation of content is not determined by author style sheets only. <a>Reading

					</ul>

					<p>In addition, the following are strongly RECOMMENDED:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>eBraille creators SHOULD NOT use properties that affect the text's font (e.g., which font
								gets applied, its size, whether it's bold, italic, etc.). Creators should assume that

								reasons, or to ensure a good reading experience).</p>

							<p>Reading devices MUST guarantee that <code>1ch</code> corresponds with the cell-to-cell

					<h4>Media queries</h4>

					<p>eBraille allows the use of media queries [[mediaqueries]] to support styling and content that is
						conditional on the type and characteristics of the device.</p>

					<p>The restrictions and recommendations in this section apply to CSS (e.g. <a
							data-cite="css-conditional#at-media"><code>@media</code></a> [[css-conditional]] and <a
							data-cite="css-cascade#conditional-import"><code>@import</code></a> [[css-cascade]] rules),
						as well as where <a data-cite="html#mq">media queries are used as a microsyntax in</a> [[html]]
						(such as in the <a data-cite="html#the-link-element"><code>link</code></a> and <a
							data-cite="html#the-style-element"><code>style</code></a> elements), and in <a
							data-cite="xml-stylesheet#"><code>xml-stylesheet</code></a> processing instructions
						[[xml-stylesheet]].</p>

					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>[=eBraille creators=] SHOULD NOT use media queries that discriminate between a braille
								display and a screen when the target medium is a braille display.</p>
							<div class="note">
								<p>The logical consequence of this is that it will be impossible to discriminate between
									visual and tactile access modes, in other words it forces rendering on a screen and
									on a braille display that are otherwise comparable, to be the same, and the CSS to
									have the same requirements.</p>
								<p>Note that we do not recommend using <a data-cite="mediaqueries#valdef-media-braille"

											><code>(grid)</code></a>, because there are currently no known CSS
									implementations that match these, so requiring [=eBraille reading systems=] to match
									them could be problematic. <!-- Another reason to not
									recommend <code>braille</code> is because it is expected to become
									deprecated.--></p>
								<p>We don't recommend using <a data-cite="mediaqueries#valdef-media-screen"
											><code>screen</code></a> because we want to be forward-compatible with a
									possible future version of the standard that supports differences in styling for
									screens vs. braille displays, might that become a requirement.</p>
							</div>
							<p>[=eBraille reading systems=] of type braille display MUST match either
									<code>braille</code> or <code>screen</code>, and SHOULD ideally match both. They

							<div class="ednote">
								<p>[[mediaqueries]] deprecates <a data-cite="mediaqueries#valdef-media-braille"

				<h3>Authoring best practices</h3>

				<p>As this is a technical specification for the eBraille format, its focus is on the technologies for
					creating [=eBraille content documents=]. It does not specify a specific manner in which the content
					must be created, as regional differences in braille codes will influence how any given publication
					is formatted.</p>

				<p>A goal of the eBraille format, however, is, as much as possible, to promote common markup practices
					across regions so that organizations and individuals can interchange files without needing to
					completely reformat them. Using common markup practices will allow [=eBraille reading systems=] to
					apply regional CSS rules, improving the readability for users expecting different braille formatting
					conventions.</p>

				<p>To this end, eBraille content documents rely primarily on the [[html]] [^global/class^] and [^/role^]
					attributes to identify formatting requirements. Augmenting core HTML elements with a common set of
					classes and roles will make eBraille publications more predictable for reformatting.</p>

				<p>The eBraille working group is working on a set of best practices to help facilitate this model. These
					include:</p>

			<h2>Primary entry page</h2>

			<section id="navdoc-intro" class="informative">
				<h3>Introduction</h3>

				<p>To make it easier to deploy [=eBraille publications=] on the web, the [=EPUB navigation document=] is
					used as the primary entry point for publications. The required file naming (<code>index.html</code>)
					and location of this file mean it will be the first document loaded when users browse to a folder
					containing an eBraille publication.</p>

				<p>By requiring the [=primary entry page=] be located in the [=publication root=], it is also easier for
					users to unzip an eBraille publication and read it locally, if they so choose. If all the other
					resources in the publication are placed in a subfolder, for example, the primary entry page will be
					the first HTML document users encounter in the unzipped folder.</p>

				<p>The primary entry page does not have to be the first document in the <a href="#spine">spine</a>,
					however. As the page is meant as an entryway for web reading, it may not be helpful to include it in
					the spine at all. Reading systems will still be able to extract the table of contents and other
					information from the document even if it is not in the spine.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="nav-req">
				<h3>General requirements</h3>

				<p>The primary entry page MUST be named <code>index.html</code>. This file has to be located in the
					[=publication root=], as defined in <a href="#fileset-structure"></a>.</p>

				<p>The primary entry page MUST be a conforming <a data-cite="epub-33#sec-nav">EPUB navigation
						document</a> [[epub-33]].</p>

				<p>As the primary entry page is meant to help browser users navigate the publication, it SHOULD NOT be
					included in the <a href="#spine">spine</a>. If the publication needs a table of contents in the
					spine, it is better to create a separate document with publication-specific formatting.</p>

				<p>As per the requirements of EPUB 3, the <a href="#manifest">manifest entry</a> for the primary entry
					page has to have a <code>properties</code> attribute with the value <code>nav</code>
					[[epub-33]].</p>

				<aside class="example" title="Manifest entry for the primary entry page">

				<p>The primary entry page MAY include [[html]] [^script^] elements only if the document is not included

						specifies the value "<a data-cite="epub-33#sec-nav-toc"><code>toc</code></a>" [[epub-33]].</p>

					<p>For compatibility with web-based rendering, the table of contents MUST also be identified by the

						[[dpub-aria]].</p>

					</aside>

					<p>The table of contents is defined by a single [[html]] ordered list ([^ol^]) in the root of the

					<h4>Page list</h4>

					<p>The page list provides users to access to static page break locations in an [=eBraille

						publication.</p>

					<p>The EPUB 3 specification requires that the page list be defined in an [[html]] [^nav^] element

						value "<a data-cite="epub-33#sec-nav-pagelist"><code>page-list</code></a>" [[epub-33]].</p>

					<p>For compatibility with web-based rendering, the page list MUST also be identified by the
						[^/role^] attribute [[html]] value "<a data-cite="dpub-aria#doc-pagelist"
								><code>doc-pagelist</code></a>" [[dpub-aria]]</p>

&lt;/html></pre>
					</aside>

					<p>The page list is defined by a single [[html]] ordered list ([^ol^]) in the root of the
							<code>nav</code> element. Each [[html]] list item ([^li^]) represents one static page break
						in the publication, with the page number wrapped inside an [[html]] anchor tag ([^a^]) that
						links to its location.</p>

					<p>Each entry in the page list MUST include the print page number equivalent in a [^title^]
						attribute [[html]]. Providing both encodings allows reading systems to match the page number
						regardless of whether the device accepts braille input or not and avoids any mistranlation of
						the page numbers if only one encoding is provided.</p>

						<p>Malicious actors could include false metadata &#8212; such as the title, author, and
							publisher &#8212; in an eBraille publication to trick unsuspecting users into believing they

				<h3>Introduction</h3>

				<p>As an [=eBraille publication=] represents a subset of an <a data-cite="epub-33#sec-epub-conf">EPUB 3

					playback.</p>

				<p>As eBraille publications can be deployed unpackaged on the web, users may not even always require a

						[[epub-rs-33]]. (Note that barring network access should not prevent users from following <a
